# Project Instructions

## Core Principles

- **Follow the ACE framework** - Use the Artifact-Centric Engineering workflow for structured development
- **Never interact with git directly** - Do not run git commands unless explicitly instructed by the user
- **Use Mermaid diagrams** - Include Mermaid diagrams in your messages to visualize architecture, flows, and relationships. Prefer multiple small, focused diagrams over large complex ones. Each diagram should illustrate a single concept or flow (e.g., one diagram per component, one per data flow). This ensures readability and prevents diagrams from becoming overwhelming.
